# Specification Quality Checklist: Product Integration and Acceptance

**Intent**: Verify that the component specification is complete, testable, bounded, and ready for clarification and planning.

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-09-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details that displace user-visible requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 passed all checklist items.
- The finalized C004 evidence policy is consumed as an upstream dependency: only `pass` may advance demonstrated mastery; other outcomes remain inspectable.
